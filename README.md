## Overview
This is resources for going from software engineer/non-software engineer to profressional in AI engineer

## About Me
I'm a Software Engineer who is really passionate to become entrepreneur, investor, and AI engineer. Was found Humaan.ai to bringing the AI to everyone to do incredible ways. Currently, I'm working as a senior software engineer in HBCL.

# Open Source Learning Projects
## Computer Vision
-  [Motion Heatmap Using OpenCV in Python](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/motion-heatmap-using-opencv-in-python) : This sample application is useful to see movement patterns over time. For example, it could be used to see the usage of entrances to a factory floor over time, or patterns of shoppers in a store.
- [Few-Shot vid2vid by NVIDIA](https://github.com/NVlabs/few-shot-vid2vid) : Pytorch implementation for few-shot photorealistic video-to-video translation. It can be used for generating human motions from poses, synthesizing people talking from edge maps, or turning semantic label maps into photo-realistic videos. The core of video-to-video translation is image-to-image translation. Some of our work in that space can be found in pix2pixHD and SPADE.
- [Gaussian YOLOv3: An Accurate and Fast Object Detector for Autonomous Driving](https://github.com/jwchoi384/Gaussian_YOLOv3) : Gaussian YOLOv3: An Accurate and Fast Object Detector Using Localization Uncertainty for Autonomous Driving (ICCV, 2019)
- [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) : Real-time multi-person keypoint detection library for body, face, hands, and foot estimation

## Natural Language Processing
- [T5: Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer) : Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer
