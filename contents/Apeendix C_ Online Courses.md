## Deep Learning
- [Deep Learning Part 1, Practical Deep Learning For Coders](http://course.fast.ai/): Taught by Jeremy Howard (Kaggle's #1 competitor 2 years running, and founder of Enlitic). Learn how to build state of the art models without needing graduate-level mathâ€”but also without dumbing anything down.
- [Deep Learning Part 2, Cutting Edge Deep Learning For Coders](http://course.fast.ai/part2.html): Where you'll learn the latest developments in deep learning, how to read and implement new academic papers, and how to solve challenging end-to-end problems such as natural language translation. You'll develop a deep understanding of neural network foundations

## Mathematics
- [Computational Linear Algebra](https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra/blob/master/README.md): This course is focused on the question: How do we do matrix computations with acceptable speed and acceptable accuracy?
